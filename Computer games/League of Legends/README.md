These files are for making ~optimal~ better buying decisions.

The AD carry stats optimizer optimizes DPS by auto-attacks in an ideal scenario where a champion can hit enemies non-stop. It doesn't take into account enemy armor and health and as such doesn't evaluate armor reduction and damage in % of enemy health.

The Defensive stats optimizer optimizes effective health as a function of health and either armor or magic resistance, or of health and both resistances.

Both optimizers might not fully take into account special stats and operate in ideal scenarios as described above. Values given in the respective files might be outdated.
